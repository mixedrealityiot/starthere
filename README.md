# Overview

The **Digital Field Worker** of the future will rely on mixed reality devices, such as the Microsoft **HoloLens**, to interact with equipment and processes in the physical world. This includes activities such as diagnosing and repairing a variety of equipment such as vehicles, compressors, pumps, chillers, airplane engines and many others.

Most modern equipment is loaded with sensors and micro-controllers that emit telemetry and can accept commands (e.g. shutdown, restart, show error message, update firmware, etc.). More and more of this equipment is also being connected, hence the term Internet of Things (IoT).

The goal of this site is to demonstrate the power of combining mixed reality with IoT to empower the Digital Field Worker of the future.

# Repos

## [OBD-II_MQTT_HoloLens](https://github.com/mixedrealityiot/OBD-II_MQTT_HoloLens)

This repo contains a prototype that demonstrates how to stream a vehicle's OBD-II data to HoloLens using MQTT, without sending the data to the cloud.

The prototype demonstrates the use case of a vehicle mechanic diagnosing vehicle issues using OBD-II data streamed to a HoloLens application.
